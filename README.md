- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yusuketpt22
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and become a frontend developer in Japan. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and just started the basics on the SoloLearn application, however, I've heard that CodeAcademy was a better place to start learning for free.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything and anything that can allow us to help each other in building a strong portfolio while enjoying the process. I am also a jazz trumpeter and would also like to work on projects that may allow me to combine the two.
- 📫 How to reach me at msenko22@gmail.com
